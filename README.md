# Arduino

This is a digital electronics project that involves the use of servo motors to control a door and a curtain, as well as LED bulbs, an external power supply, transistors as switches, an ultrasonic sensor for an alarm on the wall, and a sensor for temperature to activate a fan in case of high temperatures, all this activated through a web page created thanks to the use of an arduino wifi.

## Components used

- Arduino MRK100
- Continuous servomotor for the curtain.
- Servo of 180 degrees for the door.
- White LED bulbs.
- External 5V power supply.
- 22n22 transistors as switches.
- Breadboard to make the connections.
- Ultrasonic sensor for alarm on the wall.
- Temperature sensor to control the fan.

## Instructions

1. Connect the external 5V power supply to the breadboard.
2. Connect the Arduino to the breadboard.
3. Connect the servo motors for the door and the curtain to the Arduino.
4. Connect the LED bulbs to the breadboard and the Arduino.
5. Connect the 22n22 transistors as switches for the fan and buzzer.
6. Connect the ultrasound sensor to the Arduino.
7. Connect the temperature sensor to the Arduino.
8. Upload the project code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
9. Verify that all connections are correctly made.
10. Turn on the external power supply.

## Features

- The continuous servomotor controls the opening and closing of the curtain.
- The 180 degree servo controls the opening and closing of the door.
- LED bulbs provided white lighting.
- The transistors act as switches to turn on the fan and the buzzer.
- The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of objects near the wall and activates an alarm.
- The temperature sensor monitors the temperature and turns on the fan if the temperature is too high.
